Think about spacing your code differently to improve readability. For example, you had this code in your homework:

```{r}
SOM <- soil |>
  group_by(Forest) |>
  summarise(mean_SOM = mean(SOM_percent), sd_SOM = sd(SOM_percent))
# checked back to HW 15 - this is the format to use for summarizing and means!

```

I mad a few adjustments to this which is a bit easier to read:


```{r}
SOM <- soil |>
  group_by(Forest) |>
  summarise(
    mean_SOM = mean(SOM_percent), 
    sd_SOM = sd(SOM_percent))
# checked back to HW 15 - this is the format to use for summarizing and means!

```


Otherwise, looks great!
